                    <p>ABOUT</p><br>
                    <p>Mon Pilar is a jewelry brand focused on creating modern gold jewelry, with an emphasis on ancient craft techniques, modern timeless design, local production, and responsibly sourced materials.</p><br>
                    <p>THE DESIGNER & GOLDSMITH</p><br>
                    <p>Established in 2020 by Brigid McNellis, the brand is named after her mothers first and middle names. A multicultural artist and designer with a diverse background in the jewelry field, Brigid began learning the craft of jewelry while working as a goldsmiths apprentice, first in the US and later in Chile. Realizing she had found her calling, she went on to study jewelry at the Savannah College of Art and Design and later at Alchimia Contemporary Jewelry School in Florence, Italy. Her immersion in the ancient city of Florence with its rich traditions in crafting along with her experimental focus at school inspired her to create a brand that merged her two passions, art and craft. </p><br>
                    <p>INSPIRATION</p><br>
                    <p>At the core of the brand lies a fascination and appreciation for craft heritage and ancient cultures. Brigid researches and experiments with centuries old techniques before designing and crafting the brands own unique pieces. Throughout the collections you will discover Mon Pilars’ signature interpretation of granulation, filigree, and hand crafted chain as well as references to ancient and iconic symbols. Mon Pilar’s pieces hint at history while having their own unique and modern aesthetic. </p><br>
                    <p>OUR PROCESS</p><br>
                    <p>All of our jewelry is made by hand in our Brooklyn studio in New York.  Except for our in stock items, all jewelry is made to order and most can be customized upon request. Attention to detail is paid throughout every part of our process to ensure quality craftsmanship in each piece. </p><br>
                    <p>HANDMADE CHAIN</p><br>
                    <p>We proudly offer our signature hand crafted chains in 14 & 18 karat recycled gold. Crafted entirely by hand with techniques that have been used for centuries, each link is formed, cut, and joined together one by one, a tedious and skilled process that we believe is well worth the results.</p><br>
                    <p>SUSTAINABLITY</p><br>
                    <p>In an effort to have an ethical supply chain we outsourcing our casting exclusively to companies that use ethically mined and recycled metals in their process. The use of recycled gold means that it has less environmental impact as it did not come from new mining efforts. <br><br>
                        Our diamonds come from sources that either recycle diamonds that are already in circulation or are certified sustainably mined diamonds, meaning they are conflict-free and full participants in the Kimberley Process Certification System. <br><br>
                        We place a high importance on utilizing the most sustainable resources at our reach in hopes that we can leave a minimal footprint while creating beautiful high quality pieces that will be cherished and passed down through generations<br>
